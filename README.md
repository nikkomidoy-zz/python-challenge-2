# Lottery picks
In a lottery game, there is a container which contains 50 balls numbered from 1 to 50. The lottery game consists in picking 10 balls out of the container, and ordering them in ascending order. Write a Python function which generates the output of a lottery game (it should return a list). Also describe which unit tests you could implement to test the output of your function.

## Usage

### Run lottery file
```
python lottery.py
Lottery picks: [5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 24, 35, 42, 45]
```

### Run tests for the following test cases:
* Selected numbers only 10 by default
* Selected numbers are integers
* Selected numbers are within 1 to 50
* Custom define number balls and picks
```
